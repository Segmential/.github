## Bitfield

Hey there! We are a group of developers creating software for the world to enjoy.
We are currently working on many open sourced projects right now. These include:
* zyxt, a language aimed for versatility, portability and backwards-compatibility
* Sandbot, a modular discord bot
and some other secret projects!
